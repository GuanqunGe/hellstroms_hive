 *****************************************************************************
 ************************* Building *****************************************
 *****************************************************************************

-->enter build directory
cd build

-->run cmake on project core directory
cmake ..

-->should produce output and makefiles, to make
make

-->and deltaRes should be in the src folder, built and ready to go.

 *****************************************************************************
 ************************* Running   *****************************************
 *****************************************************************************

Havent actually changed any code yet! so usage is the the same

./deltaRes ../../../sample/mcc82 train 

..etc..


 *****************************************************************************
 *************************    ToDo   *****************************************
 *****************************************************************************

(1) remove hardcoded values, cuts..etc... Maybe have a cut.xml that contains them?

Friday Nov 10th. Mark. What I've changed:
	(1) Split most of the XX.hpp files into a header (XX.h) which is now in /inc and a source file (CC.cxx) which is now in /src
	(2) Renamed run.cpp to DeltaRes.cxx (All prgrams needs a catchy title, and ASCII art name..)
	(3) Started commenting random things.
	(4) Changed how the template<class T> in object_helper works a little to bring it more in line with c++ standards
	(5) Renamed tlimits.hpp -> gen_tlimit.h (as was wierd there being a TLimits.h in root and a tlimits.h here)
	(6) Moved to an "out-of-source build" centric model, so no build code or results is in same directory as source-code (saftey)
	(7) Moved from "makefile" to "CMake", generally gives a cross-platform/computer stability and makes building faster if only small changes
	(8) whitespacing, tap and indenting, also might hate me for that if you use emacs or something other than vim..sorry..

	A lot of this wasnt "necessary" but as I was reading through, copying and commenting to learn whats happening, it seemed a good time
Ok lets try figure out what each thing does
