Ok lets try figure out what each thing does

"run.cpp"
creates the executable, does a bit of setup but none of the powerhouse functions. Those are in:

-->"object_helper.hpp"
This is just a class for loading files easily, done.

-->"train.hpp"
containts one function, void train
which when given a long list of trees, variables..etc.. does the whole training. OKi.

-->"app.hpp"
app.. applies the MVA that was trained in stage 1, on whatever data?


-->"merge.hpp"
-->"significance.hpp"


-->"plot_bdt_variables.hpp"
-->"get_mva_response_hists.hpp"
-->"plot_mva_response_hists.hpp"
-->"tlimits.hpp"



train
app
merge
significance_sep

use gui
